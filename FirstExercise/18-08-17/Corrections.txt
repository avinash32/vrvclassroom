1)  Function which is assigned as the event listener to the text box can be written as a seperate function instead of being a closure(function keycheck).
2)  I can skip creating newItem variable inside keycheck function and use newItemInputBox.value directly in the if statement.
3)  Instead of creating letsAddNewItem() function, I can add the elements directly in the else statement itself.
4)  instead of checking for empty text as if(newItem == null||newItem == ""){
				alert("Please enter valid ToDO name");
				console.log("No item was present in the text box");
			}
	I can use reguler expressions as var regex = /^\s*$/; for checking spaces.
5)  in the function letsAddNewItem there was no need of creating the variable newItemInputBox. the value of the text box could
	be read and value can be written to it directly.
6)  the function changeState can be written as a separate function instead of declaring it as a closure.
7)  all the onclick listeners can be written as seperate functions.
8)  instead of writing deleteButton.appendChild(document.createTextNode("Delete")); this creates a new text node. Instead i can just do deleteButton.innerHTML = "Delete";
9)  if all the event listeners are seperate functions, then the eventListeners can be de-registered easily by using removeEventListeners.
10) indent properly
11) only 80 characters in a line
12) place javascript in the end of the body
13) don't use onload and onunload in the body use DOMContentLoaded in javascript
14) don't use <hr> instead use border-bottom
15) Have to delete preloaded item also
16) Store all the input todo items in an array for future use
17) array should contain checkbox id, text. status
18) don't create a textNode, instead use innerHTML
19) don't create all elements using createElement but use an array and write tags inside it
20) try using container.innerHTML = "" instead of removeChild();
21) try unregistering event handlers like button.onclick = "" instead of removeEventListeners
22) No two id should be same
23) create a button clear screen, on pressing everything should be cleared from the screen. Even the containers and preloaded items
24) Whatever is global in styling, declare it in body
25) keep the styles of related items in one place. Don't make it jumbled
26) remove redundant codes and whichever is not working
27) On resizing, the items get hidden. Use media queries to solve this
28) Add comments only where the code is impossible to understand without comments
29) No DOM traversals
30) Once the status of the checkbox is changed, it should be updated in the array which stores the input items.
